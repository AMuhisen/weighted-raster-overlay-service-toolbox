# weighted-raster-overlay-service-toolbox

Tools to create and configure data for web-based weighted overlay to support suitability modeling. 

This python toolbox helps you create and configure a mosaic dataset for use in a web-based weighted overlay analysis service. You can use these services from web-based clients like GeoPlanner for ArcGIS to help find the best place or identify risks in an area.

## Features
* Feature To Raster - Rasterize vector data using distance, density, presence/absence, or attribute processes
* Configure Raster Fields - Creates range data and labels for the suitability scale used in the weighted overlay service
* Build Mosaic Dataset - Generates a mosaic dataset from your rasters and populates range and label fields using data from Configure Raster Fields 

## Instructions

1. Fork and then clone the repo. 
2. Open ArcGIS Desktop and browse to the python toolbox.

## Requirements

* ArcGIS 10.3 for Desktop or newer 
* ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Extension for Desktop
* ArcGIS 10.3 for Server or newer (for hosting the weighted overlay service)
* ArcGIS Image Extension for Server
